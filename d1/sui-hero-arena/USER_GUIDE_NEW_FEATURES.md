## 📊 Understanding Your Stats

### Win Rate Calculation
```
Win Rate % = (Wins / Total Battles) × 100

Example:
- 10 Wins out of 20 Total Battles = 50% Win Rate
- 25 Wins out of 50 Total Battles = 50% Win Rate  
- 40 Wins out of 80 Total Battles = 50% Win Rate
```

### ELO Rating Trends
```
Starting: 1200 ELO
After 10 wins: 1200 + (10×16) = 1360 ELO
After losing 5: 1360 - (5×16) = 1280 ELO
```

### Winning Streak Counter
- Increases by 1 with each consecutive win
- Resets to 0 on loss or draw
- **Master Streak** achievement: 10+ consecutive wins!
